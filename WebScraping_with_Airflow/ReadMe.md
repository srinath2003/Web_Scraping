# Amazon Product Scraper

This is a Python script to scrape product details from Amazon India. The scraper fetches data such as product name, price, ratings, original price, and discount percentage, and saves the information in a CSV file.

## Features

- **Scrape Amazon India**: The script scrapes product data based on a given search term.
- **Product Details**: Fetches details such as:
  - Product name
  - Price
  - Original price
  - Discount percentage
  - Ratings and rating count
- **Save Data**: Data is saved to a CSV file with a timestamp for uniqueness.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `fake_useragent`
- `requests.adapters`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas fake_useragent
```
## How to Use

   Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/srinath2003/Web_Scraping.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Web_Scraping/WebScraping_with_Airflow/
```
Open the amazon_scraper.py file and update the product_name variable with the product you want to search for.

product_name = "laptop"  # Change to the product you want to search for

Run the scraper:
```
    python amazon_scraper.py
```
   The script will scrape the data and save it as a CSV file in a folder named amazon_extract_data in your current directory.

Code Explanation

    Requests: The requests library is used to send HTTP requests to Amazon's product search page.
    BeautifulSoup: BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML response and extract product information.
    Pandas: The scraped data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file.
    Retries and Delays: The script includes retry logic in case of failures (e.g., HTTP 503) and a delay to avoid overwhelming the server.

Troubleshooting

    HTTP 503 errors: Amazon may block requests if too many are sent in quick succession. The script includes retry logic and a delay between requests to help avoid this issue. If you still face errors, consider rotating your IP address using proxies.
    Missing product data: The script scrapes available product details, but Amazonâ€™s product pages may vary. Some data (e.g., ratings or original prices) may not be available for all products.
